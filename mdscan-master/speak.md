Great — for an audience of undergraduates, research students, and AI enthusiasts, your talk should balance **conceptual clarity, practical examples, and engagement**. Here's a structured outline you can follow, designed for roughly a **30-45 minute** session with room for Q\&A.

---

## **Talk Structure: “Choosing the Right AI Tool for the Right Problem”**

### **1. Introduction (5 min)**

* **Hook**: A real-world example (e.g. misapplied AI in healthcare or climate) to show that picking the *wrong* method has consequences.
* **Goal of the talk**: Help the audience learn *how to think* about matching problems to tools, not just *what tools exist*.
* **Why this matters now**: Explosion of AI methods, democratization of tools, and high-stakes domains.

---

### **2. Understanding the Landscape (7 min)**

* **Types of Problems**:

  * Prediction vs Explanation
  * Classification vs Regression vs Generation
  * Static vs Time Series vs Spatial
* **Types of AI/ML Tools**:

  * Traditional ML (SVMs, Decision Trees, etc.)
  * Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
  * Probabilistic Models (Bayesian methods)
  * Causal Inference Tools
  * Reinforcement Learning

---

### **3. Core Framework for Tool Selection (10 min)**

Introduce a simple, repeatable framework students can apply:

#### **The "PACE" Framework**

* **P**roblem type: What is the problem really asking for?
* **A**vailability of data: What do you have? Labeled data? Time series? Small datasets?
* **C**onstraints: Time, compute, explainability, bias, regulations
* **E**nd goal: Deployment? Research insights? Policy?

Use a table or matrix to show how certain combinations point to different methods.

---

### **4. Case Studies Across Domains (10-15 min)**

Break down 2–3 examples using the framework:

1. **Healthcare**: Predicting disease vs. understanding disease causes

   * Logistic regression vs. causal inference vs. transformers for EHRs
2. **Energy**: Forecasting electricity usage vs optimizing grid allocation

   * Time-series models vs. reinforcement learning
3. **Climate**: Mapping deforestation vs generating climate scenarios

   * Satellite vision models vs. generative models or simulations

Include failures or mismatches where possible to keep it real.

---

### **5. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them (5 min)**

* Chasing hype (e.g. using GPT for tabular prediction)
* Ignoring interpretability when it’s critical
* Not considering data limitations
* Mistaking correlation for causation

---

### **6. Takeaways & Closing (3-5 min)**

* You don’t need to know every tool — you need to ask better questions.
* Use the framework to guide project scoping or model selection.
* Encourage thoughtful, context-aware AI.

---

### **7. Q\&A (Optional: 10-15 min)**
